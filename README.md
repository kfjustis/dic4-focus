Full code set for Digital Image Compression Project 4

Project for messing with KLT transform as well as 2D one-level Discrete Wavelet Transform.
The program takes an image as input, applies the DWT, and applies the inverse to re-obtain
the original image.

## Running the program
    python main.py -i <input_image_file>
